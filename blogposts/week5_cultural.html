						<p>
							Pair programming has been great so far.  In particular, being able to see how others approach challenges has been awesome.  I really like bouncing ideas off of someone else to see what they think, and collaborating on creative solutions to the challenges.  It's really cool coming up with a solution that is the result of knowledge from both parties.  The best part about pair programming is when my partner and I are trying something that we're not sure will work, but ultimately making it work.  Trying something new and tweaking it until we get it right.  That moment that all the tests pass is bliss, especially when it is the result of code that is new to us - maybe something we researched while doing the challenge.<br><br>

							Thus far, the only drawback to pair programming has been that we are all remote and are pairing through google chat, stypi, and/or screen hero.  I'm really looking forward to being able to pair in person, where it will be easier to gauge your partners reactions, thoughts, willingness, attentiveness, etc..  It can be difficult trying to explain a thought over google chat, or trying to articulate an idea without being able to point to the screen or draw it out.<br><br>

							All in all, I've felt great about the feedback I've feedback so far.  It all seems to be positive, with almost no critical feedback.  I have a feeling we'll all get better at giving feedback over time, though, as we've paired more and know better what it takes to be a good peer programmer.  I think we're all still figuring it out.  It's been difficult for me to provide constructive feedback to others, because in all honesty, all of my pair sessions have been great, and there have been so few.  But I'm sure that as I pair more and more and begin to develop preferences and knowledge, it will be easier for me to provide more constructive feedback.  Based on the constructive feedback I have received, I need to make sure my internet and devices are working properly before each session, and there are also a few methods I could brush up on for the future.<br><br>

							Overall, I really enjoy the system of using pairing and feedback to guide my learning.  It's a great way to meet new people, to learn new approaches, to see things differently, and to practice teaching / explaining concepts.
