			    	<h3>Benefits of Pair Programming</h3>
        				<ul>
          					<li>The ability to collaborate and learn from other progammers</li>
          					<li>An additional set of eyes translates into better QA, testing, and more efficient coding</li>
        				</ul>
      				<h3>Steps to Successful Pair Programming</h3>
        				<ul>
        					<li>Pair programming is defined as 2 programmers working together off of the same code</li>
          					<li>It is important to understand each others' definition of being a driver and navigator</li>
          					<li>The navigator is responsible for defining the code being written, checking for syntax errors, researching new ideas, guiding the driver towards the goal</li>
          					<li>The driver is responsible for entering the code, staying mindful of errors, and collaborating on the solution</li>
        				</ul>          
      				<h3>Pros and Cons of Pair Programming</h3>
      					<ul>
        					<li><b>Pros</b></li>
        						<ul>
          							<li>It is a great way to quickly bring new programmers up-to-speed</li>
          							<li>Even for seasoned programmers, it's a great way to learn other people's best practices and approaches to be able to incorporate into their own style</li>
          							<li>It results in better QA and reduce code error</li>
        						</ul>  
        					<li><b>Cons</b></li>
        						<ul style="border-bottom: 1px solid black">
          							<li>For seasoned programmers, it reduces their efficiency and productivity because they typically like to work on their own</li>
          							<li>If there are different personalities and learning styles, it can lead to frustration and conflict</li>
        						</ul>
      					</ul>

      					<h3>My Reflection</h3>
      					<p>Pair programming with Stan was great.  We really seemed to mesh well together.  There was no friction, we were both open to eachother's ideas, and I think we both abided really well to our driver / navigator responsibilities.  I wish we could have had some more time to finalize everything, but I think we did great given the condensed timeframe.  The only difficulty I found was in that we were remote.  When either of us wanted to point out a change, a few times it took a moment or two for us to get aligned.  I feel like that wouldn't be too much of an issue in person, so I'm really looking forward to pairing up more with Stan and the rest of the cohort!</p>
