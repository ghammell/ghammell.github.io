							Shout out to all my fellow concrete random thinkers!<br><br>

							What does it mean to be a concrete random thinker?  We really like to learn through experimentation, by taking risks, and using our intuition.  Although I think these are great qualities to possess as an aspiring developer, I could see them causing some friction or setbacks while attending Dev Bootcamp.<br><br>

							I learn best through experimentation.  When I arrive at an answer through means of trying something new or different, the answer generally sticks with me much better than it would have had I simply asked someone or researched it.  In addition to that, I often find that I learn unexpected things when I experiment.  What I mean by that is, often times people experiment with <i>ways</i> to solve a specific issue, experimenting with different <i>approaches</i> for a specific end goal.  Often times I find that it is the <i>problem itself</i> that changes as a product of experimentation.  I'll come to a point where I'll say something like "Wow, I can probably solve a compeletely different problem with this approach."  I'll realize how much more I can do with a certain ability, beyond the initial problem I set out to solve.  I'm hoping these traits will translate into a great learning experience at Dev Bootcamp because I think it will be a really great environment to always try new, creative ways of solving issues - an environment where experimentation is embraced, not shunned.<br><br>

							On the other hand, I can see my thinking style occasionally getting in the way.  As a concrete random thinker, I like to have ample time to explore ideas.  I'm concerned that I'll use too much time at DBC entertaining a new idea, and not working with what I know for sure.  I'll have to figure out a way to balance experimentation with more straightforward approaches.  Another product of my thinking style is that it means that I generally work better on my own, taking the time I need to think independently about problems.  I'm really looking forward to the group project work required at DBC, so I'll have to be sure to balance independent experimentation with group collaboration.<br><br>

							My multimodal style of learning should play well with my concrete random thinking style while attending DBC.  As a multimodal learner, I like to learn through lots of means - demonstrations, reading, watching, trying, asking questions, etc..  DBC seems to be an environment where a plethora of learning devices are available.  So, when I'm thinking through a new approach to a problem, it will be great to have a variety of resources to engage, particularly a lot of other people that will have likely solved the same problem or are trying their own methods, or who could advise on a great resource to check.<br><br>

							Thus far, phase 0 has been great - I've learned a ton.  There have been a couple detriments, though.  Namely, lack of time has been a big issue.  Holding a full time job while working through the weekly lesson plans has been pretty difficult, and this is only amplified by my yearn to experiment.  It's been a bit of a struggle managing time for experimentation and the need to just get work done.  In addition to this conondrum, as I mentioned above, I really like a lot of resources to be able to learn.  Thus far into phase 0, I've mostly been limited to online readings and videos.  Although these resources are bountiful and definitely handle most of my issues, I really wish I had other people readily available to lean on when I've hit a wall with a problem.  Although solving through experimentation is great at times, sometimes a quick answer would be much better.  I know there are tutoring sessions and the google plus community to reach out to, but often times it takes time to get a response, and I find that it doesn't make sense to wait (again, the lack of time).<br><br>

							In order to curb these issues, I really need to manage the experiment tangents that I go off on.  I plan to begin to allot certain amounts of time with each challenge to experimentation.  When that time is exhausted, I'll force myself to move on.  In addition to that, I think if I start working harder to complete more of the weekly lesson plans towards the beginning of the week, that will allow for more flexibility in getting my questions answered.<br><br>

							One of the reasons I'm really excited to work in groups at DBC is that I'll get a chance to not only learn from others, but to see how they learn as well.  To take away parts of their strategies that might work for me.  By frequently collaborating with others and asking them how they learn best, that will likely help expand the ways in which I learn and think, enabling me to learn more quickly and effectively.<br><br>
