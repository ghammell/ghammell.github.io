## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

Design is not just a noun.  Design is all of the planning, research, trial and error that goes into developing a project, all in addition to the final output.  Design thinking is a concept employed by many companies today to acheive superior results.  Depending on who you're talking to, the steps involved may vary slightly, but generally speaking it boils down to: 

1) Determining what the actual problem is.  Too often, time is wasted working on solving something that isn't really the underlying issue.  Design thinking tries to avoid that through due dilligence and research in advance.  You should talk to the end users and determine what the true underlying issue is before embarking on a solution.

2) Considering many options.  With design thinking, no idea is too wild.  Often times the wild ideas provide the most creative and effective solutions.  When design thinking, every idea for a solution should be treated equal to the rest upon inception.

3) Refining your options.  Once you've compiled a comprehensive list of potential options, weed out the ones that aren't optimal.  Experiment with some of the options and if there is no traction, try something else.

4) Executing on the option that works best.

User experience is one of the ideas that interests me most about programming.  I've always been into art, and I think that interest translates into an appreciation for good design in websites and apps.  I wish I had thought to put together a wireframe prior to building my blog - it certainly would have helped streamline the process.  Working with the wireframes was pretty fun.  I used the online web app Mockflow, which had a really intuitive user experience.  Replicating the wireframes of some of my favorite sites was a really interesting exercise.

Mockflow, and wireframing in general, seems like a huge necessety in the planning of any website.  I'm certainly going to take that away from this lesson and apply it to future projects.  Wireframing was actually really fun!  I'm excited to see if I can come up with some original, yet user-friendly and appealing designs of my own.
