## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: ghammell.github.io

I had a lot of fun building the blog.  I learned a couple tips a tricks along the way in this lesson too. Ultimately it ended up taking me quite a bit of time, I think because I had some specific formats in mind that became challenges to solve.  

Pertaining to the content of the blog, this was really my first time blogging, so it was exciting!  Researching was fun because the subject matter was interesting - my favorite websites.  I imagine that should be the case when someone is blogging - that you would be researching and writing on things that you're interested about.  Otherwise, what would be the fun in blogging?  

I found the blog helpful to my learning.  I hadn't really honed in on the aspects of some of my favorite websites before.  Ultimately, I think I like my favorite websites more for their content than how they're composed, but nonetheless it was an interesting exercise to try and analyze the sites at a deeper level.  The only downside of the exercise was the the blog was kind of prescribed - it was an assignment, which is fine, of course.  But I think I will enjoy blogging a bit more when my exact interests in any moment are dictating what I write about.
