Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

The E-mail to my team:

Hey Guys!

Week 1 - good times.  

Some info on myself:

Name:  Gary Hammell
Location:  SF, CA (Polk St. for those of you that are familiar)
Favorite websites:  Reddit, Pandora, Wikipedia
Gregorc Thinking Style:  Concrete random - I love to experiment - sometimes I get ahead of myself though and next thing I know 4 hours have passed while I was trying to play around with things
Learning style: Multimodal - I like it all!  Mostly being able to do exercises myself though, as opposed to lectures / powerpoints, etc.. but I like to use all sorts of resources.
forked phase_0_unit_1 repository:  https://github.com/ghammell/phase_0_unit_1

Looking forward to working with you guys more over the next couple weeks.  I got on a quick call with Jay today which was great.  I'm hoping my work week will be much less stringent than it was last week so that I'll have more time to pair up with you guys.

Talk to you soon,
Gary

Reading other peoples' reflections has definitely made me feel better.  I mean, I've been excited the whole time - nothing has changed that.  But its comforting to know that others are nervous about not performing in the rigorous program.  Since I know that others are sharing the same mindset, it'll be easier for me to talk to everyone openly about how I'm feeling, knowing that others are likely in the same place.  My experience this week only got me more stoked!  Don't get me wrong - this week was exhausting.  Month end close at work led to some long work hours, so trying to juggle the week 1 exercises was tough.  I managed though, and the material was exciting enough that it kept me going and is keeping me yearning for more!
