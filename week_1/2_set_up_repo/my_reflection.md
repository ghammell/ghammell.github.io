Fortunately, creating repositories on GitHub is super easy, and can be accomplished in a few simple steps:
  1) Log into GitHub
  2) Navigate to the 'Repositories' tab
  3) Click 'New'
  4) Fill out a couple options:
    a) Whether you want your repository to be open to the public (meaning anyone, anywhere can access it), or private
    b) Whether you want to add a license
  5) Click 'create repository'

And, ta-dah! you're done.  You've got a repository.  What you'll want to do next is 'clone' your repository locally, which means to make a copy of the repository on your own computer.  In doing so, you are enabling a connection between your computer and GitHub so you can add and edit files that are stored online from your computer.  This is a simple process as well:

  1) In the GitHub app on your computer, click on your username in the left-side panel
  2) If you don't have many repositories, you will likely see your new one show up to the right after clicking your name,     but if you don't, type all or part of the repository name in the search bar at the top to find it
  3) Once you locate it, click 'Clone to Computer'
  
And there you go, you've cloned the repository to your local computer!

The term 'open source', in a general sense, means 'available to everyone'.  The design or blueprint of an open source project is universally available for anyone to see and edit.  In contrast, the design of a closed source (I'm not sure that that is actually a term..) project is not made publicly available.  For example, Mozilla is an open source project - the designers of the Mozilla web browser have made the source code publicly available for others to tinker with and make improvements to.  It is ultimately up to Mozilla if they want to implement those changes, but still, anyone can access the source code and play with it.  In contrast, the source code to software like Microsoft Excel is not made publicly available, meaning no one besides its creators know exactly how it was built.

I like the idea of Open Source.  Opening up your source code for others to play with and iterate on, review and suggest ideas, and improve upon allows for swift changes, more creativity, and better efficiency.  I also like the idea that existing open source projects promote the creation of more open source projects, because, dependent on the license in use, if someone uses the source code from one project on another, then they have to keep their project open.  I like to think that as I progess in the realm of developing that I will someday be tinkering with other peoples' open source projects, so the promotion of and creation of more and more of these will allow for a huge array of projects to play with and gain knowledge from.

On the downside, it would make me a bit nervous that other people might be copying my work.  I can understand why companies like Microsoft and Adobe don't open up their source code - because it would make it super easy for others to build a similiar product very quickly.  All in all, I think open source is a beautiful thing, but do not blame anyone for keeping their code a secret.

You don't necessarily need a license to share your source code with the world, but having a license is important because it will dictate exactly how others can use your code, and what rules / regulations they need to abide by.  Namely, it keeps the world aware the your project is YOUR project - you're just allowing others to help work on it.  If you let anyone access your code without a license, anyone could take your code and run with it, telling everyone it's theirs.  On the filp side, if you allow only specific people to work on your code (again, without a license), it can become cumbersome to manage who does and who does not have access.  Licensing your open source project alleviates these issues by allowing anyone to freely contribute to your project, but maintaining you as the original creator.

Really, the idea of open source was solidified for me in this challenge.  I always had a vague understanding of the concept, but didn't recognize the importance of the idea in the development world.  It makes so much sense - people are interested in particular projects and want to contribute.  Ultimately the creator of the project benefits from the contributions and gains a better understanding of what people want and what they think of the projects.  Those contributing get what they want as well (assuming others agree with their proposals).  Open source projects allow for better projects.  In addition to that, I didn't know anything about the particular licenses involved, so that was great to learn about.
