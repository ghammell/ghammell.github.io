## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection


While going through the web_basics readings, I learned quite a bit about the web.  I had heard in the past that the Internet and the World Wide Web were two different things, but the difference hadn't been solidified in my mind.  Essentially, the internet is the 'network of networks' - it is all of the connections between computers and servers, it is just the networks themselves.  The 'web' is built on top of the internet, and is composed of everything we see when working with a web browser - all of the websites, web apps, social applications, etc.. that we use on a daily basis.  The internet could exist without the web, but not the other way around.  If I had to explain the distinction to someone, I might say that the internet is like streets and highways - its the routes we take to get places, but the web is like the homes, stores, and malls that we stop at and interact with along our routes.

I had also never understood how our personal computers interact with websites.  I didn't realize what was happening behind the scenes when I open up a web page in my web browser, nor did I understand the concept of the domain name system and domain name servers.  I now know that after I type a domain name like www.google.com into my web browser, my computer looks to its personal domain server for the IP address linked to that domain name.  If the personal name server doesn't have it, it asks other domain name servers for it.  Once it locates the IP address of the domain I typed in, it connects me to the computer at that address.  That computer then sends back a bunch of code that is transformed into what I see through the web browser - pretty awesome.

Accessibility is an important concept to remember when setting up an HTML site.  Making your website 'accessible' means that it is available and easy to use for as many people as possible, including those with visual, hearing, physical, and cognitive disabilities.  An example of a way to make your website more accessible is using alt text, which is text that describes pictures.  This way users that employ screen readers due to visual disabilities can still understand the context of the images displayed.  Not only does better accessibility open your website up to more people, but usually accessibility features improve your website for everyone.

I felt great after launching my web page!  Even if it was simple, it was the first page I've ever produced myself, so it felt good.  It felt like the first of many awesome projects.

I had a slew of "aha" moments when going through the 'web concept' readings in release 0, pretty much as outlined above - the whole connection between web browsers, servers, IP addresses and the DNS was pretty new to me.  In regards to HTML, the exercise was simple enough to grasp for the time being, so I think most of my "aha" HTML moments will be in later lessons.

In regards to extra resources, I didn't do much searching in this lesson because I felt that the readings were substantial.  However, when it came time to open up the repository in Sublime Text 2, I was curious how I could do that from the command line.  After searching google and fidgeting around in the terminal a bit, the suggestions at this link ultimately worked out for me:

I'm sure that this will save me some time in the future!
