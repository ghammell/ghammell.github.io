# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

	* Responsive web design means to design a website that is able to respond to different screen resolutions imposed on it from a variety of devices.  A responsive website should adjust itself for smaller or bigger screen resolutions so that the content is still displayed in the way that the developer intends, as opposed to being thrown off when viewed from a different device.  For example, if you build a non-responsive website, the body of which is 960px wide, it might look great on a web browser, but when viewed from an iPhone, will look like its zoomed in a bunch.  The user would have to either zoom out or scroll left and right to see all the content on the page.  By making the website responsive, the margins, heights, widths, padding, etc.. of the objects within the website will automatically adjust to fit the smaller screen.  The content will be displayed elegantly on the iPhone, not in a haphazard manner.  

	I really like responsive design.  Ultimately, whether you use it or not, and to what degree, depends on the project you are working on.  But, I think it is good practice.  It depends on what you consider aesthetically pleasing, really.. and whether it is a concern of yours what users think.  Assuming most web developers are concerned with what their users think, it is definitely a good practice to make your site responsive so that the look of the site doesn't deter potential users.  It would be a shame if a potential user was just turned off from the site solely based on how it looks on a smaller device, especially if the content itself is actually what they're looking for.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
	
	* Smartphones and tablets have made it necessary to consider far more screen resolutions when building websites.  Now that there is such a breadth of screen sizes, it has become absolutely necessary to be able to imbed responsive design into a site in a simple manner.  So, the introduction of smartphones and tablets led to us literally coming up with new ways of programming to adhere to not just specific screen sizes, but ALL screen sizes.  This issue obviously isn't going away.  Because of that, I believe we'll only come up with better ways to make websites even more responsive, all while using less and less code.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

	* Visually impaired people often use screen readers when surfing the internet.  As best we can, we should design and develop for people with all types of impediments like being visually impaired.  Great websites are accessible.  What I mean is, great sites don't limit their user base - they are built to maximize the amount of people that can effectively browse them.  So, a great website will have features to aid those that are impaired when using them.  We should absolutely design and develop for the impaired.


* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

	* Responsive design has really resonated with me.  I really think it is so crucial to the success of a website.  More and more, people are accessing websites from different devices.  And soon enough, it will be way more than just computers and iphones - TVs, wristwatches, glasses, and who knows what else are going to need to be taken into consideration when building websites.  A developer will have to make sure his / her code adheres to all these specifications so that potential users aren't left on the table due to poor design.

	One thing that doesn't make sense to me that was covered very briefly in the Treehouse tutorial is the use of bars (specifically 12) to outline the webpage.  They used bars with specific widths and gutters to somehow position objects on the page.  Maybe I missed something, but I didn't understand the significance of those, and I'm not exactly sure how they worked.
