# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

	* I think web standards are good.  With generally accepted standards like the ones we studied in this lesson, peer review of code is much easier.  Because we're all applying the same standards, and expect them of each other, it's easier to collaborate on and review other peoples' projects since we're all used to setting up HTML in similiar manners (the same basic structures).

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

	* It does - its pretty straight forward.  The standard structure is just a logical way of organizing the structure of you HTML.  It makes perfect sense that you'd have a head, and a body, and within the body other elements like sections and asides.  To me, the standard structure itself, and its existence, makes perfect sense.  I do think I can hone my ability a bit more though when it comes to questions like choosing 'div' instead of 'section'.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

	* Well, I don't really know what it was like to code in the world before these elements were introduced.  I mean, I know of the term 'divitis', but never really experienced coding like that, so it's hard to compare.  But, even being new to HTML, it seems that the use of these new elements really simplifies things and makes code much more clear and easier to understand.  These elements have certainly made it pretty easy for me to open up someone else's HTML and be able to quickly absorb the high-level structure of the site.

* Why is reset.css necessary? 
	
	* reset.css was necessary to first override any default property values imposed on specific elements, before applying new styles from the styles.css sheet.  For example, the reset.css file includes a format to ul elements within the ol class that sets the 'list-style' property to 'none'.  This overrides the default 'list-style' property of ul elements, which includes bullets.  You can see that after loading the reset.css file, there are no bullets on the lists included in the website.  In addition to this, the reset file included a mass adjustment to most elements that included setting the margin, padding, and border to 0.  With this reset code introduced, the developer doesn't have to worry about remembering certain default properties for certain elements, but can instead work with the knowledge that all the elements start with the same properties.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
	
	* I pretty much always use chrome.  At work, however, sometimes I do have to switch between internet explorer and chrome, and have inadvertantly been on a couple different websites in both browsers.  So, I have noticed slight changes to websites between browsers.  I don't necessarily think that's a good or a bad thing.  Its good because the developer of the browser is doing what they think is best, and consumers can choose one browser over another based off preference.  But, it could be bad for web developers because they'll have to worry about what their website will look like in multiple browsers, which could lead to extra lines of code and more headaches.
